# My first website project named Weebz

## This is the first project of my bootcamp which instructs us to create a basic website
This is my first project as a developer which is about about something I am passionate about. The project is about a gaming website that was created using the very basics of:
+ HTML
+ CSS/SCSS
+ JSON
+ JQUERY
+ JavaScript 

The project serves no function as it is here to show off my skills as a beginner developer
The project has 3 HTML files which are the main page, the About page, and the completed list page
** I know that one of the pictures in the carousel at the beginning of the index page is not loading I am aware of it and will fix it at a later date **

## How to install project
This is a simple website that requires you to have a text editor and a browser
+ Copy all files to a folder
+ Make sure all folders are copied
+ click html files to view them in the browser
+ File can be modified in a text editor
