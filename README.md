# My first website project named Weebz

## This is first project of my bootcamp which instructs us to create a basic website
This is my first project as a developer which is about about something I am passionate about. The project is about a gaming website which was created using the very basic's of:
+ HTML
+ CSS/SCSS
+ JSON
+ JQUERY
+ Basic JavaScript fundamentals

The project serves no function as its here to show off my skills as a beginner developer
The project has 3 HTML files which are the main page , about page and the completed list page
** I know that one of the pictures in the carousel at the beginning of the index page is not loading I am aware of it and will fix it at a later date **
